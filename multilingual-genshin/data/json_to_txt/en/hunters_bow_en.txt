Hunter's Bow
A hunter's music consists of but two sounds: the twang of the bowstring and the whoosh of soaring arrows.
 Legend has it that Mondstadt once played host to one who made music on bowstringsâ€” Or perhaps it might be more fitting to say that this wandering musician used an instrument's strings to fire arrows. But this is naught but an old folk legend.
