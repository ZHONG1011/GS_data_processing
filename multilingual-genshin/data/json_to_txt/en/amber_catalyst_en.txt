Amber Bead
A catalyst carved out of amber that gains a warm halo under the sun.
 Though amber is not a type of mineral, it is still smooth and sturdy with a kind of warmth lacking among gems. It's honey-colored aura and softness in the hand is exceptionally comforting. The Amber Catalyst is said to have been the first of the divine gems gifted to the people of Liyue by the Lord of Rock. Maybe this affordable amber also harbors the gentleness of the Geo Archon.
