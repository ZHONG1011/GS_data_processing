Otherworldly Story
A cheap fantasy novel with no value whatsoever. Any claim that it possesses the power of catalysis is also pure fantasy.
 A mediocre work of fiction telling the tale of an ordinary fellow who finds himself in another world after death. That world is filled with dangers. Steel monsters as vast as galaxies lurk beneath the ground and devour people in the thousands. But there also exist powerful beings who can make rooms comfortable in any season and turn night into day with a snap of their fingers. This is a story as groundless as it is meaningless. It only shares one thing in common with the real world: most of the precious metals are owned by a handful of individuals, who keep them locked up in the vault.
