Lithic Blade
A greatsword carved and chiseled from the very bedrock of Liyue.
 A weapon favored by the Millelith of yore. Carved from the divine bedrock upon which Liyue Harbor was established, it is incomparably heavy. No ordinary human could lift this blade, let alone wield it in battle. And yet records state that the Millelith of old could use it with ease.  The Millelith was an organization first founded on the initiative of the followers of Rex Lapis. Its history can be traced to when the port city was first completed. Under Rex Lapis' and Liyue's banner they march, and will never desert it, whether in advance or retreat. "While rock stays hard, the mountain shall never fail; while the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail." The Millelith warriors adhere without fail to this code, and for it they would die without regrets.  They follow in Rex Lapis' footsteps to the best of their ability, slaying monsters, protecting the citizenry, and keeping the peace in Liyue. The Millelith made its name not in slaughter but in defense, using their own bodies to shield their homeland.  This greatsword of unmatched weight and hardness mirrors the duty and the will of Liyue's guardians. Xing and Han, the two members of this armed force who first carved stone into swords, must have known in their hearts, That in the future, those who had the strength to use these stone swords would grow few. But this also meant that the world would be at peace, and neither guardians nor swords would be needed anymore.
