Stilettos thrown by the Hold attack mode can be suspended in mid-air, allowing Keqing to jump to them when using Stellar Restoration a second time.  <color=#FFD780FF>Lightning Stiletto</color>  If Keqing uses Stellar Restoration again or uses a Charged Attack while its duration lasts, it will clear the Stiletto Mark and produce different effects: ·If she uses Stellar Restoration again, she will blink to the location of the Mark and unleash one slashing attack that deals <color=#FFACFFFF>AoE Electro DMG</color>.
