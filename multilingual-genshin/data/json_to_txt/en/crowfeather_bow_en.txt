Raven Bow
Ravens are known to be the ferrymen of the dead. This bow's limb is decorated with raven feathers, which forebode the imminent death of its target.
 Ravens are messengers of death. "Placing this feather on the limb of one's bow declares the death of one's prey." Or so claimed the weapon vendors.
