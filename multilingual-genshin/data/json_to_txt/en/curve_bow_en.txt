Recurve Bow
It is said that this bow can shoot down eagles in flight, but ultimately how true that is depends on the skill of the archer.
 A recurve bow exquisitely made from wood, bones, and animal tendons. In the hands of a masterful archer, it can shoot down eagles in flight. It is the pride of a hunter, and proof of mastery. Pity the innocent eagles.
