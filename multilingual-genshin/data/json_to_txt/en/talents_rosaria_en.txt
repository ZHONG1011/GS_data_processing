Normal Attack: Spear of the Church
<color=#FFD780FF>Normal Attack</color> Performs up to 5 consecutive spear strikes.  <color=#FFD780FF>Charged Attack</color> Consumes a certain amount of Stamina to lunge forward, dealing damage to opponents along the way.  <color=#FFD780FF>Plunging Attack</color> Plunges from mid-air to strike the ground below, damaging opponents along the path and dealing AoE DMG upon impact.
Ravaging Confession
Rosaria swiftly shifts her position to appear behind her opponent, then stabs and slashes them with her polearm, dealing <color=#99FFFFFF>Cryo DMG</color>. This ability cannot be used to travel behind opponents of a larger build.  <i>Those who confess to Sister Rosaria will be granted no absolution. All sinners shall be met with the piercing cold of punishment proportionate to the weight of their sins.</i>
Rites of Termination
Rosaria's unique take on this prayer ritual: First, she swings her weapon to slash surrounding opponents; then, she summons a frigid Ice Lance that strikes the ground. Both actions deal <color=#99FFFFFF>Cryo DMG</color>. While active, the Ice Lance periodically releases a blast of cold air, dealing <color=#99FFFFFF>Cryo DMG</color> to surrounding opponents.  <i>Judgment is such a tedious ordeal — much easier to skip that phase and get straight to the last rites. Rosaria was never very devoted to the Anemo God anyway, which makes performing them all too easy.</i>
