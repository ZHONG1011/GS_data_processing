Normal Attack: Stealthy Bowshot
<color=#FFD780FF>Normal Attack</color> Performs up to 4 consecutive shots with a bow.  <color=#FFD780FF>Charged Attack</color> Performs a more precise <color=#FFD780FF>Aimed Shot</color> with increased DMG. While aiming, flowing water will accumulate on the arrowhead. A fully charged torrential arrow will deal <color=#80C0FFFF>Hydro DMG</color>.  <color=#FFD780FF>Breakthrough</color> Yelan will enter a "Breakthrough" state after spending 5s out of combat, which will cause her next Charged Aimed Shot to have 80% decreased charge time, and once charged, she can fire a "Breakthrough Barb" that will deal <color=#80C0FFFF>AoE Hydro DMG</color> based on Yelan's Max HP.  <color=#FFD780FF>Plunging Attack</color> Fires off a shower of arrows in mid-air before falling and striking the ground, dealing AoE DMG upon impact.
Lingering Lifeline
Fires off a Lifeline that allows her to move rapidly, entangling and marking opponents along its path. When this rapid movement ends, the Lifeline will explode, dealing <color=#80C0FFFF>Hydro DMG</color> to the marked opponents based on Yelan's Max HP.  <color=#FFD780FF>Tap</color> Moves a certain distance forward swiftly.  <color=#FFD780FF>Hold</color> Engages in continuous, swift movement, during which Yelan's resistance to interruption is increased. During this time, Yelan can control this rapid movement and end it by using this Skill again.  Additionally, each opponent marked by the Lifeline when it explodes grants Yelan a 34% chance to reset her Breakthrough state.  <i>Not until she begins to tug on the strings do evildoers, crooks, and scheming villains alike know that there is no escape.</i>
