Magic Guide
Version 12. A reprint featuring corrections to Version 11 and brand-new additions based on recent developments.
 This version of the Magic Guide generated much controversy when published. In addition to the defiance of basic common sense seen in Chapter VII: Principles of the Anemo Element, errors can also be observed even concerning the basic principles of the Hydro and Electro elements. Evidently, the book was not peer-reviewed before publishing. Nevertheless, the book is still the most authoritative guide to magic in existence.
