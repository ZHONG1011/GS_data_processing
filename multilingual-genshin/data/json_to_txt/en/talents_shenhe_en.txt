Spring Spirit Summoning
#The frosted dew, silvery and dense, shall exorcise all demons. Grants all nearby party members the Icy Quill effect and deals <color=#99FFFFFF>Cryo DMG</color> in different ways based on whether it is {LAYOUT_MOBILE#tapped}{LAYOUT_PC#pressed}{LAYOUT_PS#pressed} or held.  <color=#FFD780FF>{LAYOUT_MOBILE#Tap}{LAYOUT_PC#Press}{LAYOUT_PS#Press}</color> Rushes forward together with a Talisman Spirit, dealing <color=#99FFFFFF>Cryo DMG</color> to opponents along the path.  <color=#FFD780FF>Hold</color> Commands the Talisman Spirit to deal <color=#99FFFFFF>AoE Cryo DMG</color>.  <color=#FFD780FF>Icy Quill</color> When Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks, Elemental Skills, and Elemental Bursts deal <color=#99FFFFFF>Cryo DMG</color> to opponents, the DMG dealt is increased based on Shenhe's current ATK.  The Icy Quill's effects will be cleared once its duration ends or after being triggered a certain number of times. When held rather than {LAYOUT_MOBILE#tapped}{LAYOUT_PC#pressed}{LAYOUT_PS#pressed}, the Icy Quill's effect lasts longer and can be triggered more times. When one <color=#99FFFFFF>Cryo DMG</color> instance strikes multiple opponents, the effect is triggered multiple times based on the number of opponents hit. The number of times the effect is triggered is calculated independently for each party member with the Icy Quill.  <i>The power of the spirits is no falsehood. Burdened with her orders, the divine maiden hurries on!</i>
