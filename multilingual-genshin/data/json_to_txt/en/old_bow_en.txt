Seasoned Hunter's Bow
A bow that has been well-polished by time and meticulously cared for by its owner. It feels almost like an extension of the archer's arm.
 A hunter must always be downwind, and must never walk upright on a mountain's ridge. It matters not if their target is beast, monster or the wicked â€” this method remains the same.
