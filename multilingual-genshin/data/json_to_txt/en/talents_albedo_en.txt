Abiogenesis: Solar Isotoma
Albedo creates a Solar Isotoma using alchemy, which deals <color=#FFE699FF>AoE Geo DMG</color> on appearance.  <color=#FFD780FF>Solar Isotoma</color> has the following properties: 路When opponents within the Solar Isotoma field take DMG, the Solar Isotoma will generate Transient Blossoms which deal <color=#FFE699FF>AoE Geo DMG</color>. DMG dealt scales off Albedo's DEF.  路Transient Blossoms can only be generated once every 2s. 路When a character is located at the locus of the Solar Isotoma, the Solar Isotoma will accumulate Geo power to form a crystallized platform that lifts the character up to a certain height. Only one crystallized platform can exist at a time. 路Solar Isotoma is considered a <color=#FFE699FF>Geo construct</color>. Only one Solar Isotoma created by Albedo himself can exist at a time.   <color=#FFD780FF>Hold</color> to designate the location of the skill.  <i>This Geo bloom has an unusual property mirrored in the aim of alchemy.
