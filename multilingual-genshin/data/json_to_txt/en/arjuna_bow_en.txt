Sharpshooter's Oath
This superior bow once belonged to a master archer. However, it gives off a strong scent, thus making it unsuitable for hunting.
 A long time ago, in a place far, far away... Tragedy struck. Brothers took to arms against one another. One among them was a great archer. After suffering a humiliating defeat, he made a vow: "Until I have brought down my enemies," "Until I have pierced their throats and their blood has run dry, I shall not clean my feet." And so, the great archer fell prey to a foot infection.
