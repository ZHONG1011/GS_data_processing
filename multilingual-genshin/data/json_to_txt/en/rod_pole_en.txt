Iron Point
Sharp and pointy at one end, it is a balanced weapon that is quite popular among travelers.
 A simple weapon that exudes a certain austerity. For those who defend that which they must protect, Or a traveler with naught to their name but themselves, Even the most mundane of weapons might be ten times as powerful as it seems.
