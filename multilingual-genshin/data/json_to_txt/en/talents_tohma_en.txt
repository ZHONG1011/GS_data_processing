Normal Attack: Swiftshatter Spear
<color=#FFD780FF>Normal Attack</color> Performs up to 4 consecutive spear strikes.  <color=#FFD780FF>Charged Attack</color> Consumes a certain amount of Stamina to lunge forward, dealing damage to opponents along the way.  <color=#FFD780FF>Plunging Attack</color> Plunges from mid-air to strike the ground below, damaging opponents along the path and dealing AoE DMG upon impact.
Blazing Blessing
Thoma vaults forward with his polearm and delivers a flame-filled flying kick that deals <color=#FF9999FF>AoE Pyro DMG</color>, while also summoning a defensive Blazing Barrier. At the moment of casting, Thoma's Elemental Skill applies <color=#FF9999FF>Pyro</color> to himself. The DMG Absorption of the Blazing Barrier scales off Thoma's Max HP. The Blazing Barrier has the following traits: 路Absorbs <color=#FF9999FF>Pyro DMG</color> 250% more effectively. 路When a new Blazing Barrier is obtained, the remaining DMG Absorption of an existing Blazing Barrier will stack and its duration will be refreshed.  The maximum DMG Absorption of the Blazing Barrier will not exceed a certain percentage of Thoma's Max HP.  <i>As a guest from afar, only the most burning passion would allow one to master the pure and precise spear arts of Inazuma. Thoma's mastery, indeed, is not limited to being the "swiftest-studying student" or "a master of the spear," but he has imbued his will to protect others and fend off foes into his art as well.</i>
Crimson Ooyoroi
Thoma spins his polearm, slicing at his foes with roaring flames that deal <color=#FF9999FF>AoE Pyro DMG</color> and weave themselves into a Scorching Ooyoroi.  <color=#FFD780FF>Scorching Ooyoroi</color> While Scorching Ooyoroi is in effect, the active character's Normal Attacks will trigger Fiery Collapse, dealing <color=#FF9999FF>AoE Pyro DMG</color> and summoning a Blazing Barrier. Fiery Collapse can be triggered once every 1s.  Except for the amount of DMG they can absorb, the Blazing Barriers created in this way are identical to those created by Thoma's Elemental Skill, Blazing Blessing: 路Absorbs <color=#FF9999FF>Pyro DMG</color> 250% more effectively. 路When a new Blazing Barrier is obtained, the remaining DMG Absorption of an existing Blazing Barrier will stack and its duration will be refreshed.  The maximum DMG Absorption of the Blazing Barrier will not exceed a certain percentage of Thoma's Max HP.  If Thoma falls, the effects of Scorching Ooyoroi will be cleared.  <i>"I will not forget my initial promise. Let this burning flame protect those I cherish, and may it never be extinguished."</i>
