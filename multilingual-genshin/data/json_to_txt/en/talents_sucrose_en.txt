Astable Anemohypostasis Creation - 6308
Creates a small Wind Spirit that pulls opponents and objects towards its location, launches opponents within its AoE, and deals <color=#80FFD7FF>Anemo DMG</color>.  <i>This is a little embarrassing, but though the elemental lifeforms birthed through this procedure dissipate very rapidly, they are incredibly useful when adventuring. Even failed experiments can have practical applications.</i>
Forbidden Creation - Isomer 75 / Type II
Sucrose hurls an unstable concoction that creates a Large Wind Spirit. While it persists, the Large Wind Spirit will continuously pull in surrounding opponents and objects, launch nearby opponents, and deal <color=#80FFD7FF>Anemo DMG</color>.  <color=#FFD780FF>Elemental Absorption</color> If the Wind Spirit comes into contact with <color=#80C0FFFF>Hydro</color>/<color=#FF9999FF>Pyro</color>/<color=#99FFFFFF>Cryo</color>/<color=#FFACFFFF>Electro</color> energy, it will deal additional elemental DMG of that type. Elemental Absorption may only occur once per use.  <i>Sucrose used to give names to her volatile Anemo Hypostases, but their line of heirs quickly grew to surpass Baron Bunny the 893rd.</i>
