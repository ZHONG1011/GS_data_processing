Dance of Haftkarsvar
Enters the Pirouette state, dealing <color=#80C0FFFF>Hydro DMG</color> to nearby opponents based on Nilou's Max HP. While she is in the Pirouette state, Nilou's Normal Attacks and Elemental Skill will cause her to enter the Sword Dance and Whirling Steps stances respectively, causing DMG she deals to be converted to <color=#80C0FFFF>Hydro DMG</color> that cannot be overridden and that is considered Elemental Skill DMG.  In these stances, Nilou's third dance step will end Pirouette, and has the following effects based on the type of said dance step: ·Sword Dance: unleashes a Luminous Illusion that deals <color=#80C0FFFF>Hydro DMG</color> to opponents it touches and grants Nilou the Lunar Prayer effect. This effect converts Nilou's Normal Attacks into Sword Dance techniques, and her final hit will unleash a Luminous Illusion. ·Whirling Steps: Nilou unleashes a Whirling Water Wheel that deals <color=#80C0FFFF>AoE Hydro DMG</color> and creates a Tranquility Aura that follows your active character around and applies <color=#80C0FFFF>Wet</color> to opponents within its AoE.  Nilou is unable to perform Charged Attacks when under the effect of Pirouette or Lunar Prayer. These effects will be removed once she leaves the field.  <i>"Daintily her toes touch the water's face, and the light that ripples forth equals even the seven heavens."</i>
