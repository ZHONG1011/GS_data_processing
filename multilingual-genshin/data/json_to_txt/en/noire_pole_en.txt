Black Tassel
An exceptionally powerful polearm that also offers a simple but elegant solution to the issue of the easily stained white tassel.
 One night, a Millelith officer drank with a poet, and brought his signature white-tasseled halberd with him. The poet's ink was spilled. And the halberd's white tassel was dyed black. "'Tis but a tale of polearm wielder and poet." "Unrelated to mine own black-tasseled polearm." The old smith smacked his apprentice. He demanded that he dye the newly made polearm's tassel black.
